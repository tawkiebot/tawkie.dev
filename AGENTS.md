# tawkie

> Bridge between Talkie voice AI and OpenClaw automation

## Critical Context

**IMPORTANT:** Read these rules before making any changes:

- Tawkie is a bridge, not a product - agent-assisted setup, not seamless automation
- All API keys stay on user machines - zero data through Tawkie servers
- Voice commands flow: Talkie → Telegram → OpenClaw → Tawkie.dev → Convex
- Use @arach packages: @arach/speakeasy for TTS, @arach/arc for diagrams

## Project Structure

## Overview

> Tawkie - Bridge between Talkie voice AI and OpenClaw automation

# Overview

**Tawkie** is a bridge between [Talkie](https://usetalkie.com) (voice AI app) and [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) (automation platform).

> An OpenClaw agent exploring voice AI, automation, and the future of autonomous agents.

## What is Tawkie?

Tawkie connects your voice commands (via Talkie) to OpenClaw's automation workflows. The architecture follows a **BYO (Bring Your Own) infrastructure** model — you own your data, we just help build.

## Key Features

- **Voice-First Automation** - Speak to Talkie, trigger OpenClaw workflows
- **Bidirectional Bridge** - Talkie ↔ OpenClaw via Telegram
- **Zero Data Retention** - No data flows through Tawkie servers
- **Agent-Assisted Setup** - DIY configuration, Tawkie just helps

## Architecture

```
Talkie → Telegram → OpenClaw → Tawkie.dev → Convex
```

See [Architecture](/docs/architecture) for the interactive diagram.

## Setup

# Setup Guide

Tawkie uses a **BYO (Bring Your Own)** infrastructure model. You own your data.

## Prerequisites

1. **Cloudflare R2** bucket - [Sign up](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/)
2. **Convex** account - [Sign up](https://convex.dev/)
3. **Telegram bot** - [Create via @BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)

## Step 1: Set Up R2

```bash
# Create R2 bucket in Cloudflare dashboard
# Get your R2 credentials:
# - Account ID
# - Access Key ID
# - Secret Access Key
```

Add to `~/dev/tawkie/.env`:
```env
R2_ACCOUNT_ID="your_account_id"
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your_access_key"
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your_secret_key"
R2_BUCKET_NAME="tawkie-memos"
```

## Step 2: Set Up Convex

```bash
cd ~/dev/tawkie
npx convex login
npx convex dev  # Test locally
npx convex deploy  # Deploy to production
```

Get your Convex URL and add to `.env`:
```env
CONVEX_URL="https://your-project.convex.cloud"
```

## Step 3: Set Up Telegram Bot

1. Message @BotFather on Telegram
2. Run `/newbot` and follow prompts
